### About

This code is for creating a Tidy Dataset built from original data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

A full description can be obtained at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

### Unzipping

Unzipping the original file creates a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset", which should be the working directory for running this code.

The unzipping process also creates two subdirectories (test and train) where some of files will be stored.

### Output

The code will create a txt file called newdataset.txt that will be written in the working directory "UCI HAR Dataset".
