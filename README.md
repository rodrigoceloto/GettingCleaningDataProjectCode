GettingCleaningDataProjectCode
==============================
This code is for creating a Tidy Dataset from Samsung file getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip.

Unzipping this file creates a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset", wich should be the working directory for running this code.

The unzipping process will create two subdirectories (test and train) where some of files will be stored.

The code will create a txt file called newdataset.tx that will be written in the working directory "UCI HAR Dataset".
